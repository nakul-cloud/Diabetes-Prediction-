# Diabetes Prediction  

## Overview  
This project is a **machine learning-based web application** for predicting whether an individual is at risk of **diabetes** based on key health metrics. The system is built using **Flask** and a **Random Forest model**, trained on medical data. Users can enter their health details, and the model will predict whether they are likely to have diabetes.  

The goal of this project is to leverage **AI/ML techniques** to provide an accessible and fast prediction tool for early diabetes detection.

## Prerequisites  
To run this project, you will need the following Python packages:  

- **Flask** (for web framework)  
- **NumPy** (for numerical operations)  
- **Joblib** (for loading the trained model and scaler)  
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning processing)  

Install all dependencies using:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
